This project is a simple C# chatbot designed to educate users about cybersecurity. It features an interactive experience where the chatbot answers questions on topics like password safety, phishing, and safe browsing. The program includes a voice playback on Windows, ASCII art logos, and colored text for visual appeal. Users are greeted and prompted to ask questions, and the chatbot provides detailed responses or guidance on various security topics. It runs in a loop, allowing users to interact until they type exit. The chatbot aims to make learning cybersecurity practices fun and engaging for users.
